        <h1>Creating Poster <span>One</span></h1>
        <p>In order to design these posters, I considered a range of design techniques to implement. For instance, I made the title on each of the three posters in a large, customised unique font instead of default system fonts. I achieved this by using the website inpx.com and entered my own text, tweaking the style sliders to my liking and then importing them into InDesign.</p>
        <p>For my first poster, I wanted a vibrant, eye catching colour theme so I went with pink and blue as these colours contrast with eachother very well. I used a background image of Bristol Clifton bridge as that is the city's main attraction, and added my own gradient to fit my colour theme editing the image. I aligned the title at the top, and the sponsors on the left margin of the poster to allow space for the main section of the poster where I included the images of the festival reveling to the viewer of the poster the main parts of the attraction.</p>
        <p>I believe the structure of this poster is done very well as I've made an effort to put all of the information on the surrounding areas of the poster, allowing space for the main attraction itself which is the images of the festival.</p>
      </div>
      <div class = "posttextbox">
        <h1>Creating Poster <span>Two</span></h1>
        <p>I had a lot of fun creating this poster because I used a unique process to create an incredible looking theme for the poster. In order to create the theme of the poster I imported an image of Clifton Bridge, edited it in Photoshop to remove the colour then cropped out the sky, after that I made a square the same colour as the grey sky from the original image, and added a gradient effect to white, allowing the image to have an appealing contrast theme from black to white.</p>
        <p>When considering the other principles of CARP, I used the fact the image was all black and white to my advantage, after inserting loads of balloons throughout the image acheiving the repitition effect, I decided to make one unique amoungst the rest and gave this one colour. This allowed the poster to achieve the proximity principle.</p>
        <p>In terms of alignment, I made the sponsors at the bottom and all information at the top of the page to allow space for the main image which takes up about two thrids in the center. Following these principles of CARP gave the poster an astonishing look which I believe would intrigue people about the Bristol Balloon Fair.</p>
      </div>
      <div class = "posttextbox">
        <h1>Creating Poster <span>Three</span></h1>
        <p>When considering my third posters design I wanted to take a different approach and use a more unique process of designing a poster. After looking for inspiration online I decided to create a hexagon themed poster in which the hexagons would be aligned perfectly between eachother and contain the images and infromation the poster was expressing, and for the background I decided to make it a map of bristol itself instead of Clifton bridge.</p>
        <p>I considered the placement and alignement of the contents of the poster carefully, taking advantage of the extra space the background image revealed which wasnt Bristol, and thats where I placed the hexagons. I would argue this alignment is the best form of algnment for this poster as it allows the non important parts of the background image (the surrounding areas of Bristol) to be used as a basis for the information and images I want to show, and reveals the full map of Bristol which is the location for the attraction of the poster.</p>
        <p>I also managed to include an element of contrast by adding a gradient colour and blur effect to the map which spans the whole poster giving a sunset theme. This transformed the map into something boring to significantly more appealing to the eye as it allows the contents of the poster to stand out more, giving me another great example of why following the principles of CARP allow for incredible poster design.</p>

        <h1>Typography Tasks Submission</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="typographytextbox">
        <p>This is the section of my GWDS site where I showcase my completed typography tasks.</p>
        <img style="border: 4px solid black" src="Axial.png" alt="Axial" width="450" height="450"/>
        <div class = "typotextbox">
          <h1>Axial</h1>
          <p>In order to create this Axial typograph, I had to figure out how to create unique shapes to fit within my canvas giving the illusion that they continue after instead of being cut off. The blue background in this image are two rectangles that I cut to create the image using the Pathfinder tool in the view section of InDesign.</p>
        </div>
        <img style="border: 4px solid black" src="Radial.png" alt="Radial" width="450" height="450"/>
        <div class = "typotextbox">
          <h1>Radial</h1>
          <p>Creating a radial typograph was slightly more difficult than most of the others as I found the adjusting vertical text process quite difficult to align. After a while of getting used to the alignment system of vertical text I was able to create a great looking typograph.</p>
        </div>
        <img style="border: 4px solid black" src="Dialational.png" alt="Dialational" width="450" height="450"/>
        <div class = "typotextbox">
          <h1>Dialational</h1>
          <p>I initially found the Dialational typography creation difficult as I was unable to figure out how to create curved text on its own, and when I figured that out I encountered a very specfic resizing problem trying to perfectly resize and align the curved text around a circle. After realising there was a easier way to do it than manually, I simply entered the dimensions of each of the round text instead of resizing whilst it was perfectly aligned with the circles in the middle, for instance the small text would be 50mm x 50mm, then 75mm x 75mm, then 100mm x 100mm. I was extremely happy with the result as it solved the alignment and resizing issue I had when trying to manually create this image. </p>
        </div>
        <img style="border: 4px solid black" src="Random.png" alt="Random" width="450" height="450"/>
        <div class = "typotextbox">
          <h1>Random</h1>
          <p>I could argue that the Random typography is the easiest to design because in my experience of creating this, I implemented all of the elements I had previously used from the other designs altogether in no particular order. Because of this, I didn't have to think carefully about placement of objects and did not have to consider the dimensions as then it wouldn't be random.</p>
        </div>
        <img style="border: 4px solid black" src="Grid.png" alt="Grid" width="450" height="450"/>
        <div class = "typotextbox">
          <h1>Grid</h1>
          <p>Grid was certainly one of the easiest to create. After minimal research I learnt that InDesign has a command in the object menu allowing you to create a perfectly aligned grid along the canvas, additionally allowing me to input the amount of rows and collumns. After doing this it was easy for me to identify the sections where I would want to place my text and shapes, so I resized them accordingly to the grid. </p>
        </div>
        <img style="border: 4px solid black" src="Modular.png" alt="Modular" width="450" height="450"/>
        <div class = "typotextbox">
          <h1>Modular</h1>
          <p>When researching modular typography most of the designs I found were made simply of squares, rectangles & circles. This evidently influenced my modular typograph yet I still managed to make each object within the typograh a different size, allowing for some more variety.</p>
        </div>
        <img style="border: 4px solid black" src="Transitional.png" alt="Transitional" width="450" height="450"/>
        <div class = "typotextbox">
          <h1>Transitional</h1>
          <p>Creating the transitional typograph required me to learn how to curve text multiple times on a singular line. I found it challenging for a short time as I initially was trying to figure out how to curve a text box instead of a line with added text, but once I realsied this error I enjoyied the process of creating a swril/wave themed typograph. I learnt that transitional typograhy will always show a point A to B and thats exactly how I designed mine to look.</p>
        </div>
        <img style="border: 4px solid black" src="Bilateral.png" alt="Bilateral" width="450" height="450"/>
        <div class = "typotextbox">
          <h1>Bilateral</h1>
          <p>Bilateral typograhy is extremely simple therefore I was able to create this typograph in just a few short minutes. Although it is extremely simple I do like prefer it to the more complex forms of typography such as dialational or transitional as it presents a nice blocky theme which can appeal to anyone. </p>

            <p>I used numerous elements of what I learnt in these three worksheets when creating this webiste. For instance the buttons on the navigation bar. When they are hovered over, a smooth animation will qucikly take place, changing their apperance from blue to pink, and slightly increasing their size allowing for an improved user experience.</p>
            <p>I found the final task to be interesting as I learnt how to import text from the web which isn't already specified in HTML. As we can see in the second image, I was using a unique font for the header called Zen Dots which gave my website a more custom design than what the majority of standard websites use, and I believe this is a crucial element in creating a unique website. Ultimtely I decided I wanted to use that font on this particular page for the website, which is why the header of this section looks very unique. </p>
