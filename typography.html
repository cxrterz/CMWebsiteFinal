        <div class = "typotextbox">
          <h1>Axial</h1>
          <p>In order to create this Axial typograph, I had to figure out how to create unique shapes to fit within my canvas giving the illusion that they continue after instead of being cut off. The blue background in this image are two rectangles that I cut to create the image using the Pathfinder tool in the view section of InDesign.</p>

        <img style="border: 4px solid black" src="Radial.png" alt="Radial" width="450" height="450"/>
        <div class = "typotextbox">
          <h1>Radial</h1>
          <p>Creating a radial typograph was slightly more difficult than most of the others as I found the adjusting vertical text process quite difficult to align. After a while of getting used to the alignment system of vertical text I was able to create a great looking typograph.</p>
        </div>
        <img style="border: 4px solid black" src="Dialational.png" alt="Dialational" width="450" height="450"/>
        <div class = "typotextbox">
          <h1>Dialational</h1>
          <p>I initially found the Dialational typography creation difficult as I was unable to figure out how to create curved text on its own, and when I figured that out I encountered a very specfic resizing problem trying to perfectly resize and align the curved text around a circle. After realising there was a easier way to do it than manually, I simply entered the dimensions of each of the round text instead of resizing whilst it was perfectly aligned with the circles in the middle, for instance the small text would be 50mm x 50mm, then 75mm x 75mm, then 100mm x 100mm. I was extremely happy with the result as it solved the alignment and resizing issue I had when trying to manually create this image. </p>
        </div>
        <img style="border: 4px solid black" src="Random.png" alt="Random" width="450" height="450"/>
        <div class = "typotextbox">
          <h1>Random</h1>
          <p>I could argue that the Random typography is the easiest to design because in my experience of creating this, I implemented all of the elements I had previously used from the other designs altogether in no particular order. Because of this, I didn't have to think carefully about placement of objects and did not have to consider the dimensions as then it wouldn't be random.</p>
        </div>
        <img style="border: 4px solid black" src="Grid.png" alt="Grid" width="450" height="450"/>
        <div class = "typotextbox">
          <h1>Grid</h1>
          <p>Grid was certainly one of the easiest to create. After minimal research I learnt that InDesign has a command in the object menu allowing you to create a perfectly aligned grid along the canvas, additionally allowing me to input the amount of rows and collumns. After doing this it was easy for me to identify the sections where I would want to place my text and shapes, so I resized them accordingly to the grid. </p>
        </div>
        <img style="border: 4px solid black" src="Modular.png" alt="Modular" width="450" height="450"/>
        <div class = "typotextbox">
          <h1>Modular</h1>
          <p>When researching modular typography most of the designs I found were made simply of squares, rectangles & circles. This evidently influenced my modular typograph yet I still managed to make each object within the typograh a different size, allowing for some more variety.</p>
        </div>
        <img style="border: 4px solid black" src="Transitional.png" alt="Transitional" width="450" height="450"/>
        <div class = "typotextbox">
          <h1>Transitional</h1>
          <p>Creating the transitional typograph required me to learn how to curve text multiple times on a singular line. I found it challenging for a short time as I initially was trying to figure out how to curve a text box instead of a line with added text, but once I realsied this error I enjoyied the process of creating a swril/wave themed typograph. I learnt that transitional typograhy will always show a point A to B and thats exactly how I designed mine to look.</p>
        </div>
        <img style="border: 4px solid black" src="Bilateral.png" alt="Bilateral" width="450" height="450"/>
        <div class = "typotextbox">
          <h1>Bilateral</h1>
          <p>Bilateral typograhy is extremely simple thus I was able to create this typograph in just a few short minutes. Although it is extremely simple I do like prefer it to the more complex forms of typography such as dialational or transitional as it presents a nice blocky theme which can appeal to anyone. </p>
