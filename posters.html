    <h1>CARP Posters Submission</h1>

    <p>This is the section of my GWDS site where I showcase my posters implementing the principles of CARP. (Contrast, Proximity, Repitition, Alignment)</p>

      <h1>Creating Poster <span>One</span></h1>
      <p>In order to design these posters, I considered a range of design techniques to implement. For instance, I made the title on each of the three posters in a large, customised unique font instead of default system fonts. I achieved this by using the website inpx.com and entered my own text, tweaking the style sliders to my liking and then importing them into InDesign.</p>
      <p>For my first poster, I wanted a vibrant, eye catching colour theme so I went with pink and blue as these colours contrast with eachother very well. I used a background image of Bristol Clifton bridge as that is the city's main attraction, and added my own gradient to fit my colour theme editing the image. I aligned the title at the top, and the sponsors on the left margin of the poster to allow space for the main section of the poster where I included the images of the festival reveling to the viewer of the poster the main parts of the attraction.</p>
      <p>I believe the structure of this poster is done very well as I've made an effort to put all of the information on the surrounding areas of the poster, allowing space for the main attraction itself which is the images of the festival.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "posttextbox">
      <h1>Creating Poster <span>Two</span></h1>
      <p>I had a lot of fun creating this poster because I used a unique process to create an incredible looking theme for the poster. In order to create the theme of the poster I imported an image of Clifton Bridge, edited it in Photoshop to remove the colour then cropped out the sky, after that I made a square the same colour as the grey sky from the original image, and added a gradient effect to white, allowing the image to have an appealing contrast theme from black to white.</p>
      <p>When considering the other principles of CARP, I used the fact the image was all black and white to my advantage, after inserting loads of balloons throughout the image acheiving the repitition effect, I decided to make one unique amoungst the rest and gave this one colour. This allowed the poster to achieve the proximity principle.</p>
      <p>In terms of alignment, I made the sponsors at the bottom and all information at the top of the page to allow space for the main image which takes up about two thrids in the center. Following these principles of CARP gave the poster an astonishing look which I believe would intrigue people about the Bristol Balloon Fair.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "posttextbox">
      <h1>Creating Poster <span>Three</span></h1>
      <p>When considering my third posters design I wanted to take a different approach and use a more unique process of designing a poster. After looking for inspiration online I decided to create a hexagon themed poster in which the hexagons would be aligned perfectly between eachother and contain the images and infromation the poster was expressing, and for the background I decided to make it a map of bristol itself instead of Clifton bridge.</p>
      <p>I considered the placement and alignement of the contents of the poster carefully, taking advantage of the extra space the background image revealed which wasnt Bristol, and thats where I placed the hexagons. I would argue this alignment is the best form of algnment for this poster as it allows the non important parts of the background image (the surrounding areas of Bristol) to be used as a basis for the information and images I want to show, and reveals the full map of Bristol which is the location for the attraction of the poster.</p>
      <p>I also managed to include an element of contrast by adding a gradient colour and blur effect to the map which spans the whole poster giving a sunset theme. This transformed the map into something boring to significantly more appealing to the eye as it allows the contents of the poster to stand out more, giving me another great example of why following the principles of CARP allow for incredible poster design.</p>
